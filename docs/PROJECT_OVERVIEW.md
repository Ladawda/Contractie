# Contractie - Project Overview

## The Problem
Homeowners struggle to find reliable, verified contractors. Current solutions are:
- Word-of-mouth (limited reach)
- Generic classifieds (unverified, risky)
- Expensive lead services (pay per lead, no quality guarantee)

## The Solution
**Contractie** - A marketplace connecting verified contractors with serious homeowners.

- Contractors join **free**
- Homeowners **pay to post** jobs ($25)
- Manual license verification ensures quality
- Simple matching by location

## Target Users

### Contractors (Free to Join)
- Licensed professionals seeking new clients
- Want qualified leads, not tire-kickers
- Willing to verify credentials for trust

### Homeowners (Pay to Post)
- Serious about their project
- Want pre-vetted contractors
- Value quality over quantity of bids

## Key Differentiators
